Below I provide links to a variety of my analytics experience, from short data science projects, to my recent PhD thesis on computational models of vision, as well as earlier work related to biological motion (i.e., human movement).

### Data Science
- Data cleaning: slides summarizing a large-scale DarkNet data cleaning project, carried out in collaboration with a Boston-based health-informatics company Epidemico (Tools: MySQL / Python)
- Machine learning: summary and code from a project on diabetes prediction from health survey data (Tools: R)

### PhD Thesis in Computational Neuroscience
- Thesis: a copy of my thesis, which characterized the encoding and decoding of luminance contrast (i.e., brightness information) in human vision.
- Behavior: example Matlab code used for detecting saccadic eye-movements and analyzing human decision behavior (**see Chapter 2, ~p.25-30 for methods description)
- Mathematical model: example Matlab code implementing an Information Theory-based model of luminance contrast encoding and decoding in vision (**see Chapter 3, p.44-50 of thesis for related math)
