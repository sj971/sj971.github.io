title: DarkNet | Tracking the underground drug trade

## Background and Problem

During my time at Insight, I carried out a consulting project in collaboration with researchers at epidemico.com, a Boston-based data science company working in the population health domain.

These days you can buy almost anything you want online.

I employed standard Python packages (e.g., Beautiful Soup, Pandas) to extract and organize relevant information from individual HTML listings, such as.....
