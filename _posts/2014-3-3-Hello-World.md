title: DarkNet | Tracking the underground drug trade
---

## Background

During my time at Insight, I carried out a consulting project in collaboration with researchers at epidemico.com, a Boston-based data science company working in the population health domain.

## The Problem

These days you can buy almost anything you want online. Unfortunately, in parallel to legitimate internet commerce, a network of underground sales channels have spawned into life over the past decade or so, with powerful pharmaceuticals and harder drugs forming a large proportion of sales listings. While many of these so called 'DarkNet' sites eventually succumb to law enforcement endeavours or internal fraud, numerous large-scale marketplaces still exist such as AlphaBay and East India Company. 

## The Dataset

The dataset consisted of an archive of sales listings from a popular, underground marketplaces known as 'Evolution'. Listings were scraped at semi-regular intervals between January 2014 and March 2015, and were downloaded in their original, raw HTML format from a publicly available archive [give link]

## Cleaning the Data (D1)

Parsing and cleaning approximately half-a-million listings requires mutliple tools.
