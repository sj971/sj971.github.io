I am a seasoned, full-stack data science consultant (**BCG**, **IBM**), with domain expertise spanning **healthcare, insurance, and financial service** industries.

Previously, I completed a **PhD** in computational neuroscience at **New York University**, working on problems related to precision in visual short-term memory.

In my spare time I like to travel (particularly in the Desert Southwest), and am a proficient amateur songwriter and method actor.
