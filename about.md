I am a **data science consultant (BCG, IBM)** with domain expertise spanning **healthcare, insurance, and financial services**.

Previously, I completed a **PhD in computational neuroscience** at **New York University**, working on problems related to precision in visual short-term memory.

In my spare time I like to travel, and can occasionally be found fronting a small folk band at venues around NY and elsewhere.
