I recently completed a **PhD** in **Computational Neuroscience** at New York University, working on problems related to precision in visual short-term memory. 

Previously I worked as a research assistant at Vanderbilt University, and studied psychology and cognitive science at University College Dublin, Ireland.

In my spare time I like to travel, and occasionally I front a small folk band at venues around NYC.
