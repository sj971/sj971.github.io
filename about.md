I am an industry data scientist and consultant, with domain expertise spanning healthcare, insurance, and financial services in particular.

Previously, I completed a **PhD in Computational Neuroscience** at **New York University**, working on problems related to precision in visual short-term memory.

In my spare time I like to travel, and can occasionally be found fronting a small folk band at venues around NY and elsewhere.
