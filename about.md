I recently completed a Ph.D. in computational neuroscience at New York University, working on problems related to precision in visual short-term memory.

Prior to that I worked as a research assistant at Vanderbilt University, and studied psychology and cognitive science at University College Dublin, Ireland.


In my spare time, I like to travel, and occasionally I play music with [a small, folk band](http://www.seafarersunite.com).
