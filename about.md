I recently completed a Ph.D. in Neural Science at New York University, with a focus on computational models of vision.

Prior to that I worked as a research assistant at Vanderbilt University, and studied psychology and cognitive science at University College Dublin, Ireland.

In my spare time, I eat too much, read too little, and play music with [a small, folk band](http://www.seafarersunite.com).
